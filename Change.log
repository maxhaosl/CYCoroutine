CYCoroutine V1.0.0 features:
1. Base C++ 20 coroutine implementation
2. The interface is simple and easy to use and supports cross-platform.
3. Thread Pool.
4. Timer.
5. Ranges.
6. concept constraint.
7. coroutine lock.

Included plugins:

2025-11-24:
1. Apple universal libraries: `Build/build_mac.sh` automatically calls `lipo` after completing arm64 and x86_64 builds to generate universal static and dynamic libraries under `Bin/macOS/universal/<config>`. `Build/build_ios.sh` creates universal libraries when at least two iOS architecture artifacts are detected, making them directly available to CYLogger and other upper-level projects. README updated with documentation on Apple platform universal library artifacts and usage.
2. Linux toolchain requirements: README documents that Linux platform defaults to requiring `clang-17`/`clang++-17`, and provides `CYLOGGER_CC` / `CYLOGGER_CXX` override examples to ensure the same toolchain is used as CYLogger dependency builds.
3. Windows static-only library: `Build/build_windows.bat` fixed CMake parsing errors caused by trailing slashes in `%SOURCE_DIR%` and unified CRLF line endings to avoid label lookup failures. Windows build script now only accepts `Static` library type and rejects `Shared` option at entry point; static builds still compile `CYCoroutineExample`, while shared library targets are disabled. `Build/build_windows_all.bat` defaults to `LIB_LIST=Static` and explicitly skips Shared combinations in the matrix loop, ensuring only static `CYCoroutine.lib` exists under `Bin/Windows/<arch>/<CRT>/<config>` directory.

2025-04-01:
1. Fixed the compilation problem of VS engineering different platforms.
